# C Projects

This is a repo of work I have created in C. So far most of it is from [Dan Gookin](https://dangookin.com)'s books and courses in Programming in C.

Some of it is work I've amended and some is straight up copies of examples. It might be useful to somebody.

`N.B. Numbered folders are books and chapters from C for Dummies`

Here are some files in relation to the Dan Gookin books on C and some other work I have that has sparked my interest.
