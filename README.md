# C Projects

This is a repo of work I have created in C. So far most of it is from [Dan Gookin](https://dangookin.com)'s books and courses in Programming in C.

Some of it is work I've created from ideas I've had and some are amended copies of examples I've found. It might be useful to somebody.

`N.B. Numbered folders are books and chapters from C for Dummies`
